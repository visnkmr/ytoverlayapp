## Why was this app not released via Amazon AppStore

We tried publishing this app in the appstore but got the following as the reason for rejecting publication,

"We consider a variety of factors as we evaluate each app, including the customer experience offered on the device and compatibility with the device. While our goal is to offer a broad and compelling assortment of apps to Amazon customers, not all apps available through Amazon Appstore are currently available on Amazon devices.Because your app overrides the native user experience (e.g., with a lockscreen, wallpaper, or widget), it has not been published on Amazon devices."
